# Front End Mentor Project Repository
## Outline

This repository stores all the projects I have completed from the website https://www.frontendmentor.io/.

Front End Mentor provides real-world challenges that can be solved using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The point of their projects is to provide experience in creating functional applications. 

I use these projects to help develop my skills as a web developer, build my knowledge and confidence in Front End Development, and improve my problem solving skills. These projects also provide a space to experiment with libraries and tools.

Each of the projects tests skills in different ways. Some are design templates meant to be recreated for responsive web design, while others have required functions. To test the applications, please download the project containing all the files. Once you have all the files, click the index.html to start the application locally.

### Project 1 - Review Card

My first project is a simple review card, where the user provides a number and submits their review, which is logged and then the data is reused in the thank you card. There is no database for storing these numbers, as I focused only on front-end development and the user side of this project. Instead, the card uses javascript to store the input data and create a responsive thank you card after submission of the rating.

The javascript uses an if statement to verify the user has selected a number. If the user has selected a number, they are allowed to proceed; however, if they have not chosen a number, the button does not take them through to the next stage. I did not include an error message as this was not part of the design files given, and I thought a user would understand that a form option must be selected before proceeding.

Please read the README.md in the Project 1 folder to find out more. [View Project 1](https://joseph-worthington.github.io/FrontEndMentorProjects/project-product-review//).

### Project 2 - Product Preview
The second project from Front End Mentor is a product review card. The card contains no functional design and is strictly a static card for a product. I used the Figma design file to help me design the mobile and desktop version of the site. It is made using responsive design principles using a CSS grid for the main layout of the card and flex to align items within the main grid layout.

The card required an image to be added as part of the visual design. Here I had a dilemma; on the one hand, I could create an image element, but I often find these difficult to manage, so instead, I made a div with a background image, allowing me to control the position of the image more easily.
