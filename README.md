# Front End Mentor Project Repository
## Outline
This repository stores all of the projects I have completed from the website https://www.frontendmentor.io/.

Front End Mentor provides real-world challenges that can be solved using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The point of thier projects is to provide expereince creating functional appliucations that are functional. The depth of the project is left to the developer.

I use these projects to help develop my skills in each of these languages but also to improve my probleming solving skills. These project also provide a space to experiment with libraries.

Each of the projects is a fully function application on its own. To test the applications please download the Project with all the files contained. Once you have all the files just clickt eh index.html to start running the application locally. 

### Project 1 - Review Card
My first project is a simple review card, where the user provides a number and submits their review which is then logged and reused in the thank you card. Their is database for storing these numbers, as I focused only on the front end development and user side of this project.

To find out more please read the README.md in the Project 1 folder. [View Project 1](/Project%201/)
