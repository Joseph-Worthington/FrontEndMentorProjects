This repository stores all the projects I have done from the website www.frontendmentor.io

My first project "Project 1" is a form submit web app. The project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to show a form submit that when interacted with will change to a thankyou message. 

As part of the functionality the form also logs the number chosen and resubmits into the final thank you message.
