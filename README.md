# Front End Mentor Project Repository
## Outline
This repository stores all of the projects I have completed from the website https://www.frontendmentor.io/.

Front End Mentor provides real-world challenges that can be solved using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The point of thier projects is to provide expereince creating functional appliucations that are functional. The depth of the project is left to the developer.

I use these projects to help develop my skills in each of these languages but also to improve my probleming solving skills. These project also provide a space to experiment with libraries.

Each of the projects is a fully function application on its own. To test the applications please download the Project with all the files contained. Once you have all the files just click the index.html to start running the application locally.

### Project 1 - Review Card
My first project is a simple review card, where the user provides a number and submits their review which is then logged and reused in the thank you card. Their is no database for storing these numbers, as I focused only on the front end development and user side of this project. Instead the card uses javascript to store the input data and create a responsive thank you card after submission of rating. 

The javascript also uses an if statment to verify that a number has been selected before allowing the user to proceed. I did not include an error message as this was not part of the design files give and I thought a user would understand that a option must be selected before proceeding. 

To find out more please read the README.md in the Project 1 folder. [View Project 1](https://joseph-worthington.github.io/FrontEndMentorProjects/project-product-review//)

### Project 2 - Product Preview

The second project from Front End Mentor is a product review card, the card contains no functional design and is strictically a static card for a product. I used the figma design file to help me design the mobile and desktop version of the site. It is made using resposive design principles using css grid for the main layout of the card and flex to align items within the main grid layout. 

For the background image a decided to use a div with the image as a background image rather than a img element as I don't think the image is integral to the information on the page, so someone using a screen reader would not loose anything from the lack of image element. To find out more please go to the READ.me inside project-review-item-card.
