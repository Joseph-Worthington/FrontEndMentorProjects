let submitFrom = () =>{
    onclick()
}

//Main function on click the current output will be hidden and the thank you message will become visable.  

//Create an onclick event that targets the display of wrappers around the submit card and the thank you card.

//The function must also log the number chosen, this must be stored.

// How does the computer know which option was selected?

// Do the buttons need an onlcick, or a change event?

//The stored numebr then needs to be outputed into the html of the thank you message

//Might also wish to include a return button
